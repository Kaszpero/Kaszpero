- ⚡ Fun fact: Where do kiwi fruit come from?
- The kiwifruit or Chinese gooseberry, is the edible berry of a woody vine in the genus Actinidia.
- The shorthand kiwi is also in use, but is often avoided, especially in New Zealand, because of confusion with the bird or the informal name for New Zealanders.
